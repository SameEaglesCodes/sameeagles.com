## My First Blog Post

Published on: 2024-12-20

Welcome to my _new blog_ right now I am learning Astro, because I saw some article about using astro to share your obsidian notes.  My plan is to run several blogs from my obsidian vault located, conviniently hosted on (https://github.com/sameeaglescodes/2ndbrain)[GitHub].  The collections seemed like an interesting feature.

## What I've accomplished so far.

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
